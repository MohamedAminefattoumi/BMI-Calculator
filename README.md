# BMI-Calculator
This project is a BMI Calculator web app that uses a FastAPI backend to calculate BMI based on user inputs (weight and height). The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, utilizing the Fetch API to communicate with the server. The app displays the BMI result with health messages in a modern, responsive interface.
